There are three elements on the page. 
First, there is some text. 
Center the text horizontally using inline styling.
Second, there is a button.
Third, there is a counter.
The text should initially say "Hello there."
The button should say "Click me!"
The counter should be 0.
When the button is clicked, change the text to "Clicked!"
When the button is clicked again, change the text back.
When the button is clicked more than 10 times, show an alert.
The alert says "Oy, stop that."
When the alert is shown, also change the button text to red, using
inline styling.
